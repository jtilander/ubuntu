# jtilander/ubuntu

This is some standard settings and packages that I usually need when building Docker images based on ubuntu. 

One would use this as a base image and then extend it.

This image is about 250MB (which is kind of crazy!), if you need a smaller base image, you should look at https://github.com/jtilander/alpine instead.
